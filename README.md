This app show the actual Ethereum price and the chart of all Ethereum data. In addition it is possibile to run a forecast with the choosen number of observation.

## Ethereum

Ethereum is an open source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.
Ether is the cryptocurrency generated by the Ethereum platform as a reward to mining nodes for computations performed and is the only currency accepted in the payment of transaction fees.
Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer.

### Aim of this project

The purpose of this package is to show the stock exchange index of the cryptocurrency Ether.
It is possible to view:
  * the real-time value of the index;
    * it can be updated by a button;
  * the chart (updated daily) of the trend of the index;
  * the chart (updated daily) of the trend of the index with a Moving Average;
  * the forecast of the future trend of the index;
    * in this case it is also possible to choose the number of observations on which to base the forecast.

## Data sources

* [Quanld](https://www.quandl.com) - The premier source for financial, economic, and alternative datasets, serving investment professionals. It is used for getting the daily data for all the charts.
* [ethereumprice](https://ethereumprice.org/live/) - A website where we get the live value of Ethere with some web scraping.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing and run

Install the R package

```R
devtools::install_github('unimi-dse/fdaa5907')
```

Load the package

```R
require(ethereum)
```

For getting the data is necessary to set a API key for the Quandl libray. For do it you can go on [Quanld](https://www.quandl.com) website and create a FREE account. If you simply want to test the app you can use the following key: 

```
"-GNJxjPntak8s-AxpM5o"
```

The key must be setted with the function setKeyAPI() in this way:

```R
setKeyAPI("-GNJxjPntak8s-AxpM5o")
```

Now, it is possible to run a Graphical User Interface with the command:

```R
 GUI()
```

### Documentation and Test


It's possible to see the documentation (how it works) of the developed functions, by typing:

```R
?getEth()
?calculateRange()
?getPricePerc()
?setKeyAPI()
?GUI()
```
